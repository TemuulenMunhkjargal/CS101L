You’ll need to use many types of loops for this assignment.  Some may be nested in others, for instance you may have an outer loop in a game that keeps playing, and an inner loop performing another iterative task.  You’ll want to think and experiment with the best ways to implement.  In this lab, the great prognosticator “Flarsheim”, will let the user choose a number in their head from 1 to 100.  It will then ask the remainder of this number when divided by 3, 5 and 7.  Your program must validate proper input on each.  The remainder when divided by 3 can only be 0, 1 or 2.  The remainders for 5 and 7 are different.  To find what number the user is thinking of just find the number from 1 to 100 that has the same remainder for 3, 5, and 7 and astound them withthe result.They are then asked if they want to play again.  The player may enter Y or N only.You can work on this bottom up or top down.  Bottom up means working on individual low level details first.  For instance, possibly write the code to get input for the remainder of 3.  Remember it has to validate that, so the loop should continue to run while the user gives bad input.  Top down means you work on the overall flow first without any details filled in.  Possibly create the outer loop to continue playing, then with successive iterations keep applying more detail.
